This is a full-stack project focused on API integration.
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, where basic APIs for user management are developed first.
These APIs handle tasks like user registration, login, profile management, and CRUD operations.
The frontend consumes these APIs to provide an interactive user interface.
Data is stored in MongoDB, and Mongoose is used for database operations.
The project demonstrates the workflow of developing APIs first, then integrating them into the frontend.
It is ideal for learning full-stack development and REST API integration.
Environment variables are used to configure the server and database connection.
The frontend can be tested with the backend APIs running locally.
This project provides a clean foundation for building scalable full-stack applications.
